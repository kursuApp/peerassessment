The need for peer assessment is gaining importance since academics devote the time they would spend on research to checking homework assignments, which interrupts both their development and the development they will convey to their students and fails to reinforce learning. However, peer assessment practices are known to have problems such as the confusion caused by the large number of students involved, the lack of high-quality feedback from peer assessors, and social concerns about grading the assessee. To contribute to the solution of the existing problems that necessitate and complicate the implementation of peer assessment, we developed a different model from the general literature. The model provides an anonymous peer review based on grade point allocation, built on distributed ledger technology to ensure transparency and reliability. The model was first tested on a sample scenario. Then, the model was piloted on a small group of students, and student feedback on the implementation was included. In future studies, it is planned to carry out more comprehensive piloting of the model by making adjustments based on student feedback.
